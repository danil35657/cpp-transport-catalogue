# cpp-transport-catalogue

## Description

The transport catalog is intended for storing information about bus routes and stops, calculating the length and visualizing the route map.

## Instructions for use

Download the archive with the project to the local directory of your PC. It is necessary to have a C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.) or an IDE with C++ support.  We recommend using the latest versions of compilers or IDE. 

To compile a project and build an executable file (using the GCC compiler as an example), run on the command line:
```
g++ *.cpp â€“o catalogue
```
Next, run the executable file "catalogue" on the command line.

An example of using a transport catalog is contained in the "main" file. If necessary, delete the lines with examples or comment out.
